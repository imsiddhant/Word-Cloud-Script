# Word-Cloud-Script
I completed this project during the "Crash course on Python" course on Coursera taught by Google. 
This project was the final assignment of the course. I created a “word cloud” from a text by writing a script. 
This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.
